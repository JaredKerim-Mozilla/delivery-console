# CONTRIBUTING

When contributing code to the repository, here are a few things to know:

## CODE

- Push feature branches to your own fork and make pull requests from there to Mozilla.
- The pull-requests will all run in CircleCI.
- Every new developer feature should come with documentation. E.g. "How to run lint checking". New tools and tricks that comes in without documentation is a fail.
- Unit tests should concern itself with "public APIs" as much as possible, and not the internal implementation of any one feature/function.
- Avoid global CSS that isn't tied to a specific component.
- Run lint check and all tests locally before making a pull request using `yarn run lint`. In any case, pre-commit hooks will block your commit if there are linting issues. You can (but should not) skip the pre-commit hooks with `git commit --no-verify ...`.
- Don't assume that network calls always work. Check for and deal with failing network calls beyond console.error.
- camelCase all the things (except class names) and camelCase acronyms. I.e. myUrl instead of myURL.
- Favor simple over complex.
- All comments should explain why, never what.
- Favor conformity and consistency instead of personal preference.


## FORMATTING

- CircleCI builds will fail if there's any linting issues. You can check linting issues with `yarn run lint`, and auto-fix some of them using `yarn run lint:prettier-eslintfix`.
- It's very convenient to [configure your editor](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) to "auto-format on save".


## SOCIAL

- You are not your code. This means that comments on your code don't aim at you, but at how the _code_ can be improved.
- Be kind. To everyone.
- Tell us before tackling a big issue, by commenting in the issue itself and asking to be assigned to it.
- Ask us before adding a new feature or changing a big part of the code, for example by opening an issue. This way, we'll be able to comment on the idea before it's being implemented!
- We don't accept PR that change the formatting (adding or removing all the semicolons for example). We use automatic formatting (see above). If you think we should change the configuration, feel free to open an issue to comment on it.
