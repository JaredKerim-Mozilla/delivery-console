Configuration
=============
All configuration happens through environment variables.

Delivery Console settings
-------------------------
An environment variable like ``REACT_APP_FOO`` controls the setting ``FOO``.

.. envvar:: REACT_APP_SENTRY_PUBLIC_DSN

    :default: ``null``

    Optional. The DSN for Raven to report errors to Sentry.

.. envvar:: REACT_APP_NORMANDY_API_ROOT_URL

    :default: ``https://localhost:8000/api/``

    The root url for the Normandy API that should be used.

.. envvar:: REACT_APP_OIDC_CLIENT_ID

    :default: ``hU1YpGcL82wL04vTPsaPAQmkilrSE7wr``

    The Auth0 client ID to be used when authenticating.

.. envvar:: REACT_APP_OIDC_DOMAIN

    :default: ``auth.mozilla.auth0.com``

    The Auth0 domain to use for authenticating the user.

.. envvar:: REACT_APP_OIDC_CALLBACK_URL

    :default: The TLD origin for the current URL

    The URL to redirect users back to after the Auth0 authentication dance is complete.

.. envvar:: REACT_APP_OIDC_AUDIENCE

    :default: ``https://${OIDC_DOMAIN}/userinfo``

   The audience for the access token that is generated by Auth0.


.. envvar:: REACT_APP_REFRESH_AUTH_PERIOD_SECONDS

    :default: 300

    How often to issue a silent authentication refresh. Technically, when you're logged in,
    an infinite loop is run that refreshes your access token forever. And this number is
    number of seconds to sleep between each check.

.. envvar:: REACT_APP_REFRESH_AUTH_PREEMPTIVE_SECONDS

    :default: 900

    How soon *before* the session expires do we perform a silent authentication to keep it fresh.
    If you set this really low (or even to zero) the risk is that the access token has expired
    by the time it's needed for an API endpoint call.
